As part of a larger panel discussion, Frank explores the role of allyship within a small but growing group of non-Indigenous exhibitors who are attempting to program more Indigenous films and highlight important Indigenous issues while doing so. Frank’s work questions the feasibility of film exhibition to work as activism, allyship’s effectiveness, use as an easy fix for White guilt, and its place in this movement, and issues of visual sovereignty. In looking for potential pitfalls that non-Indigenous exhibitors may be susceptible to when they position themselves as activists and allies to Indigenous causes through film, Frank acutely problematizes, critiques, and provides solutions for this increasingly popular “quick solution” within the worlds of independent art house cinemas and film festivals.
