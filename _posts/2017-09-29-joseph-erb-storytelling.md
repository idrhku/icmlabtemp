Indigenous communities are adapting traditional oral stories for use in digital media. Stories are being transformed into different types of media across communities including film, animation, social media, and localization, for example. These new forms of expression are transforming how the communities share and transfer stories, language and narratives to the next generation. While these communities have welcomed new digital platforms for storytelling, Indigenous values and beliefs remain the core of these stories.
