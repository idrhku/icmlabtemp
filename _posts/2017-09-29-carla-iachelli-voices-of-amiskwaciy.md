Carla Iaccheli, Digital Literacy Librarian the Edmonton Public Library, discusses digital projects which provide a platform for Indigenous voices in the community. [The Voices of Amiskwaciy](https://voicesofamiskwaciy.ca/) project, a collaborative initiative between the Edmonton Public Library and Indigenous communities and individuals in Edmonton, provides a digital space for creating, sharing, and archiving stories that Indigenous communities wish to share. Noting the history of indigenous dispossession and systemic racism in Canada, Iaccheli traces how this library project seeks to tell Indigenous stories while being firmly guided by the perspectives and concerns of local Indigenous communities.

Presented by Carlia Iaccheli at the [IDRH Digital Humanities Forum 2017: Digital Storytelling](https://idrh.ku.edu/dhforum2017), University of Kansas, September 29, 2017
