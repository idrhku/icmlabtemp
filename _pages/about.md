The Indigenous Critical Media Lab (ICM Lab) is a collaborative research and teaching co-op for the exploration of digital arts and research. Based at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS, the goals of the Lab are to:

* provide infrastructure for humanities and arts research based in Indigenous methods, cultural expression and language revitalization
* Rethink methods of digital humanities and media arts from a perspective of Indigenous epistemologies, pedagogies, and protocols
* Build local and regional communities of practice, knowledge sharing and mentorship
* Offer a program of public engagement
